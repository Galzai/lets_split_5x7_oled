A QMK collaborator is a keyboard maker/designer that is interested in helping QMK grow and fully support their keyboard(s), and encouraging their users/customers to submit features, ideas, and keymaps. We're always looking to add more keyboards and collaborators, but we ask that they fulfill these requirements:

* **Have a PCB available for sale** - unfortunately there's just too much variation and complications with handwired keyboards.
* **Maintain the your keyboard's directory** - this may just require an initial setup to get your keyboard working, but it could also include accommodating changes made to QMK's core.
* **Approve and merge your keyboard's keymap pull requests** - we like to encourage users to contribute their keymaps for others to see and work from when creating their own.

If you feel you meet these requirements, shoot us an email at hello@qmk.fm with an introduction and some links to your keyboard!
