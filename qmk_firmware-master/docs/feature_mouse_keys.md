# Mousekeys


Mousekeys is a feature that allows you to emulate a mouse using your keyboard. You can move the pointer around, click up to 5 buttons, and even scroll in all 4 directions. QMK uses the same algorithm as the X Window System MouseKeysAccel feature. You can read more about it [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_keys).

## Adding Mousekeys To a Keymap

There are two steps to adding Mousekeys support to your keyboard. You must enable support in the Makefile and you must map mouse actions to keys on your keyboard.

### Adding Mousekeys support in the `Makefile`

To add support for Mousekeys you simply need to add a single line to your keymap's `Makefile`:

```
MOUSEKEY_ENABLE = yes
```

You can see an example here: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/clueboard/keymaps/mouse_keys/Makefile

### Mapping Mouse Actions To Keyboard Keys

You can use these keycodes within your keymap to map button presses to mouse actions:

|Long Name|Short Name|Description|
|---------|----------|-----------|
|KC_MS_UP|KC_MS_U|Mouse Cursor Up|
|KC_MS_DOWN|KC_MS_D|Mouse Cursor Down|
|KC_MS_LEFT|KC_MS_L|Mouse Cursor Left|
|KC_MS_RIGHT|KC_MS_R|Mouse Cursor Right|
|KC_MS_BTN1|KC_BTN1|Mouse Button 1|
|KC_MS_BTN2|KC_BTN2|Mouse Button 2|
|KC_MS_BTN3|KC_BTN3|Mouse Button 3|
|KC_MS_BTN4|KC_BTN4|Mouse Button 4|
|KC_MS_BTN5|KC_BTN5|Mouse Button 5|
|KC_MS_WH_UP|KC_WH_U|Mouse Wheel Up|
|KC_MS_WH_DOWN|KC_WH_D|Mouse Wheel Down|
|KC_MS_WH_LEFT|KC_WH_L|Mouse Wheel Left|
|KC_MS_WH_RIGHT|KC_WH_R|Mouse Wheel Right|
|KC_MS_ACCEL0|KC_ACL0|Set Mouse Acceleration Speed to 0|
|KC_MS_ACCEL1|KC_ACL1|Set Mouse Acceleration Speed to 1|
|KC_MS_ACCEL2|KC_ACL2|Set Mouse Acceleration Speed to 2|

You can see an example in the `_ML` here: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/clueboard/keymaps/mouse_keys/keymap.c#L46

## Configuring the behavior of Mousekeys

The default speed for controlling the mouse with the keyboard is intentionaly slow. You can adjust these parameters by adding these settings to your keymap's `config.h` file. All times are specified in miliseconds (ms).

```
#define MOUSEKEY_DELAY             300
#define MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL          50
#define MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED         10
#define MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX       20
#define MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_MAX_SPEED   8
#define MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_TIME_TO_MAX 40
```


### `MOUSEKEY_DELAY`

When one of the mouse movement buttons is pressed this setting is used to define the delay between that button press and the mouse cursor moving. Some people find that small movements are impossible if this setting is too low, while settings that are too high feel sluggish.

### `MOUSEKEY_INTERVAL`

When a movement key is held down this specifies how long to wait between each movement report. Lower settings will translate into an effectively higher mouse speed.

### `MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED`

As a movement key is held down the speed of the mouse cursor will increase until it reaches `MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED`.

### `MOUSEKEY_TIME_TO_MAX`

How long you want to hold down a movement key for until `MOUSEKEY_MAX_SPEED` is reached. This controls how quickly your cursor will accelerate.

### `MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_MAX_SPEED`

The top speed for scrolling movements.

### `MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_TIME_TO_MAX`

How long you want to hold down a scroll key for until `MOUSEKEY_WHEEL_MAX_SPEED` is reached. This controls how quickling your scrolling will accelerate.
